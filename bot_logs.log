En gros tu laisse un avis sur un article que tu ne recoit pas et on te paye 10€ pour cela.

Attention, ce n’est pas tres éthique car tu ne tests pas réellement le produit, donc a toi de voir si tu préfère rester éthique ou non

2024-09-09 15:29:43,630:INFO:Detected FAQ Entry - Question: c’est quoi les colis vides ?, Answer: Les colis vides c’est le fait d’acheter un colis ou tu aura rien dedans et en echange on te rembourse + une com d’environ 10€.

En gros tu laisse un avis sur un article que tu ne recoit pas et on te paye 10€ pour cela.

Attention, ce n’est pas tres éthique car tu ne tests pas réellement le produit, donc a toi de voir si tu préfère rester éthique ou non

2024-09-09 15:29:43,657:INFO:Detected FAQ Entry - Question: FAQ : Que signifie le Self Pay ?, Answer: Le Self Pay correspond à la somme que tu devras payer pour le produit. Par exemple, si un produit est remboursé à 100% mais qu'il y a un Self Pay de 10€, cela signifie qu’après avoir reçu ton remboursement, tu devras envoyer ces 10€ à l’intermédiaire via PayPal (que ce soit à @luckay si tu passes par lui, ou à un autre intermédiaire sur Facebook, Telegram, etc.).

**Pourquoi y a-t-il un Self Pay ?**

Sur certains produits, en particulier les gros produits, l’intermédiaire ne reçoit pas de commission de la part du vendeur Amazon pour avoir organisé le test. Dans ces cas-là, le Self Pay représente la commission que l’intermédiaire demande directement au testeur.

Dans notre cas, avec notre bot, nous travaillons avec un intermédiaire pour les gros produits plutôt qu’avec le vendeur directement. Pour certains produits, cet intermédiaire impose un Self Pay que nous devons ensuite lui reverser. Nous n’avons donc pas encore la possibilité de supprimer le Self Pay et devons suivre les conditions imposées par notre partenaire.

**Comment cela se traduit pour toi ?**

Au lieu de voir un remboursement de 90% pour un produit, tu verras "remboursement 100% + Self Pay 10€". 

Cela ne change rien pour toi en pratique. Par exemple, pour un produit à 100€ :

- Si le remboursement est de 90%, tu recevras 90€.
- Si le remboursement est de 100% mais avec un Self Pay de 10€, tu recevras 100€ mais devras envoyer 10€ en retour, ce qui revient au même.

Le Self Pay est simplement une manière différente de gérer la commission de l’intermédiaire.

2024-09-09 16:04:07,668:INFO:Detected FAQ Entry - Question: c’est quoi les colis vides ?, Answer: Les colis vides c’est le fait d’acheter un colis ou tu aura rien dedans et en echange on te rembourse + une com d’environ 10€.

En gros tu laisse un avis sur un article que tu ne recoit pas et on te paye 10€ pour cela.

Attention, ce n’est pas tres éthique car tu ne tests pas réellement le produit, donc a toi de voir si tu préfère rester éthique ou non

2024-09-09 16:04:07,670:INFO:Detected FAQ Entry - Question: si je n’ai pas eu mon commentaire publier au bout de 2 jours, dois je m’inquiéter ?, Answer: Non en general amazon prends 2 jours pour te valider ton commentaire mais cela peux aller jusqu’a 30jours grand maximum, personne ne sait pourquoi mais desfois c’est plus long sur certains produit! 

Si ca fait plus de 7jours, il faut pas hésiter à contacter l’intermédiaire pour lui demander si d’autre personne sont également en attente de commentaire pour ce produit.

Mais pas de panique tant que tu peux renvoyer ton produit, tu as le temps

2024-09-09 16:04:07,673:INFO:Detected FAQ Entry - Question: FAQ : Que signifie le Self Pay ?, Answer: Le Self Pay correspond à la somme que tu devras payer pour le produit. Par exemple, si un produit est remboursé à 100% mais qu'il y a un Self Pay de 10€, cela signifie qu’après avoir reçu ton remboursement, tu devras envoyer ces 10€ à l’intermédiaire via PayPal (que ce soit à @luckay si tu passes par lui, ou à un autre intermédiaire sur Facebook, Telegram, etc.).

**Pourquoi y a-t-il un Self Pay ?**

Sur certains produits, en particulier les gros produits, l’intermédiaire ne reçoit pas de commission de la part du vendeur Amazon pour avoir organisé le test. Dans ces cas-là, le Self Pay représente la commission que l’intermédiaire demande directement au testeur.

Dans notre cas, avec notre bot, nous travaillons avec un intermédiaire pour les gros produits plutôt qu’avec le vendeur directement. Pour certains produits, cet intermédiaire impose un Self Pay que nous devons ensuite lui reverser. Nous n’avons donc pas encore la possibilité de supprimer le Self Pay et devons suivre les conditions imposées par notre partenaire.

**Comment cela se traduit pour toi ?**

Au lieu de voir un remboursement de 90% pour un produit, tu verras "remboursement 100% + Self Pay 10€". 

Cela ne change rien pour toi en pratique. Par exemple, pour un produit à 100€ :

- Si le remboursement est de 90%, tu recevras 90€.
- Si le remboursement est de 100% mais avec un Self Pay de 10€, tu recevras 100€ mais devras envoyer 10€ en retour, ce qui revient au même.

Le Self Pay est simplement une manière différente de gérer la commission de l’intermédiaire.

2024-09-09 16:04:07,708:INFO:Detected FAQ Entry - Question: C'est quoi le no-review ?, Answer: le no review est le fait de commander un produit, et d’avoir le remboursement sans mettre d’avis, juste une commande. Les vendeurs ont juste besoin de commande pour augmenter leurs chiffre du nombre de commande, il te demanderont seulement de leurs envoyer une photo en priver du produit pour etre sur que tu la bien commandé.

2024-09-09 16:04:07,709:INFO:Detected FAQ Entry - Question: Combien de produits puis-je avoir par mois ?, Answer: Je conseille 12 produits par mois maximum pour ne pas risquer de te faire bannir ton compte. 

Étant donné qu'il y a des produits allant de 5 à 1100 euros, tu peux générer en moyenne (fourchette très basse) 1209 euros, mais tu peux faire beaucoup plus.

2024-09-09 16:28:04,470:INFO:Detected FAQ Entry - Question: Que faire si mes commentaires Amazon ont t supprims ou si je ne peux plus poster de commentaires?, Answer: Cela signifie que votre compte ou celui des vendeurs a t repr par Amazon, ce qu'on appelle tre "banni de commentaire." En rponse, Amazon a supprim les commentaires, soit des vendeurs, soit de votre compte. 

**Voici comment dterminer la situation :**

Essayez de poster un commentaire 5 toiles. Si cela ne fonctionne pas, vous tes probablement banni.

Il existe 3 types de bannissement :

 Ban partiel : Vous pouvez encore commenter avec 1/2/3/4 toiles, mais plus avec 5 toiles.
 Ban total : Vous ne pouvez plus commenter du tout.
 Ban fourbe : Vos commentaires 5 toiles semblent passer, mais vrifiez quelques jours aprs pour voir s'ils n'ont pas t supprims. Cela peut viter de mauvaises surprises lors de futures transactions.

Pour dterminer le type de bannissement, essayez de poster un commentaire 4 toiles. Si cela passe, c'est un ban partiel ; sinon, c'est un ban total.

Que faire ? Malheureusement, il y a peu d'options une fois que votre compte est ban  part changer de compte. 

Ca vous arrive ? Venez me dm directement afin que je vous aide  rgler le problme.

Transactions en cours : Si vous avez des transactions en cours, contactez vos intermdiaires avant d'essayer un retour Amazon. Expliquez la situation et demandez s'il y a des alternatives (feedback vendeur (mettre un commentaire sur le profil de la boutique, Q&A, 4 toiles...). Attention, les vendeurs peuvent refuser ces alternatives ; ils seront les mieux placs pour vous conseiller au cas par cas.
